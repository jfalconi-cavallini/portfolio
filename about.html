            <div class="year-section">
                <h2>0.</h2>
                <p>I was born in Lima, Peru on March 16,2000. My parents are Jose Falconi and Vanessa Cavallini. 
                    I have 4 younger brothers who were all born in the United States.</p>

                <h2>2.</h2>
                <p>At two years old I moved to the United States. My dad had already left before my Mom and I so for a moment I was 
                    very confused about where my dad was. However, it was soon after where my family got to be reunited and my new journey would begin.

                <h2>4.</h2>
                <p>At four years old I started to attend preschool in Merced,Ca. It was not my first time attending school as 
                    I have already attended school in Peru, I practically begged my mom to let me go to my aunts private school. It was 
                    at this age that I fell in love with learning and getting as smart as possible. I craved knowledge and wanted to learn about
                    anything and everything.</p>

            <div class="year-section">
                <h2>8.</h2>
                <p>At eight years old, my dad started to figure out how smart I was and how quickly I was able to grasp new concepts. 
                    He began to teach me many valuable lessons and a good work ethic. I learned many valuable life lessons through the educational/inspirational videos 
                    he made me watch along with the endless amount of books he made me read. I was very competitive so I tried to read as many books at school to achieve the 
                    highest amount of A.R. points I could. My dad saw this and made me read much more complex books about investing, one of my favoirte books ended up being "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki, a book my dad had to pay me to start reading and then stopped paying me as I progressed. This was a lesson I later saw he took from the book. 
                    My dad taught me many things including how to trade from such a young age. In addition to this my parents had a party rental store so my dad would often take me on deliveries to set up chairs, tents, and bounce houses.
                    I spent the majority of my weekends working with my parents, I often hated it but only now have come to realize all the benefits and the great work ethic I have been able to develop.

                <h2>14.</h2>
                <p>At 14 years old, I have just graduated middle school as valedictorian. I was excited to begin highscool and continue my education. However, I knew little about anything as I was the oldests and only and first person from my family to receive my education in the United States.
                    There was so much more for me to learn, luckily I developed a relationship with my highschool counselor who helped me along the way. In addition to this many of my teachers gave me tips and told me about 
                    new oppurtunies such as AP classes. I began to challenge myself and take as many AP classes as I could. I also always loved to swim as a kid so I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try out for the water polo team. Later in the spring I decided to step out my comfort zone again and try
                    out for the tennis team. I worked very hard and was able to make the varsity team for both sports. This was also around the time I was an amateur boxer so I was kept busy. My competitive nature was apparent in any task I took on, I hated the idea of quitting and only wanted to be the best at whatever I did.
                    I wanted to make a name for myself so I decided to create a new club at my low-income highschool, I co-founded Science Olympiad with my waterpolo teammate and we formed the first team to ever compete for Golden Valley Highschool. We went out and recruited all of the smartest people in our school to see if they were 
                    interested in applying the things we have learned on real life applications and projects. This is one of the first moments I saw a glimpse of coding. There was a scratch competition portion where I first saw block coding. This peaked my interest and decided to learn more on own as well as sign up for AP Computer Science Principles my senior year of highshcool. </p>

                <h2>16.</h2>
                <p>At 16 years old, I learned that I had no green card. It was when I was trying to obtain my drivers license that I found this out from my parents.
                    At first I was very annoyed and upset because I didn't know what I had to do. Luckily, DACA was recently created and there was some hope. This only fueled the flame inside of me and drove me to work even harder than before. I started learning python and how to code on my own. It was very poor written code but I didn't know that back then.
                    My dad also bought me my first computer, a MacBook Pro, where I was able to create my first app using swift. </p>

                <h2>18.</h2>
                <p>At 18 years old, I graduated as Valedictorian from my highschool with a 4.833 gpa. I had worked so hard my entire life for this moment. I wanted to be the first person in my family to attend and graduate from college. I got accepted to a variety of great colleges but ultimtely ended up deciding on attending the University of California, San Diego. A place I learned to call my new home.
                    I was able to learn more at UC San Diego than I was able to learn my entire life. I was fascinated with the people I met and all the new concepts I was thought. I was so eager to learn so I decided to sign up 
                    for a computer science proram for incoming students with little to no prior coding experience (SPIS). It was here I met alot of my friends and formed connections with many professors. Thanks to these connectiosn I was guided on to the right path.
                    There were many points in college where I questioned my intelligence and feared I wasn't smart enough for this. There were many moments where I wanted to drop out, however, the thought of
                    failure repulsed me so I decided to continue working as hard as I could. "Sleep is for the weak" was my mantra.  </p>

After many years of pulling all nighters, questioning life, and so many exams, we finally did it. However, this is only the beginning ...</p>
